# Shared_Projects
This repository is to highlight personal projects I am willing to share publicly and are independent of the bootcamp projects (some of my solo projects have been "borrowed" from that repo).

The code for my two websites, [Checkered Scissors] (https://www.checkeredscissors.com/) and [Pegamoose Games] (https://pegamoosegames.com/), do use source control, but only locally on the develpment system. I intend to share some of my design decisions by providing smaller code samples via this repo.

## About the Projects
+ Boomerang: This code demonstrates how most of my communications between the browser page, javascript, and PHP background communicate. A non-NodeJS solution to manipulating my websites.
+ DragAndDrop: This code sample demonstrates how to make elements moveable on a webpage. This sample presents a game of Tic Tac Toe. It allows freeform movement of pieces, without the restirction of piece placement.
+ Mario: This sample, I was playing around, trying to create an 8-bit image colorizing rows of div containers.
+ Turn Tracker: A sample of code to track piece state changes, to simulate game t
urn history.
+ Ultimate PRS: While trying to get a better understanding of React, I created this enhanced version of Paper, Rock, Scissors.

I welcome you to explore these samples and offer any constructive criticism.
